# Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project predicts **student academic performance** (Pass/Fail or Final Score) using machine learning techniques.  
The goal is to analyze how factors such as study time, attendance, and previous grades affect student outcomes.

This project is designed for **machine learning intern roles** and focuses on data preprocessing, model comparison, and evaluation.

## Objectives
- Analyze student academic data
- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Train and compare multiple machine learning models
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Predict student performance effectively

## Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  
- **Type:** Tabular data  
- **Features include:**
  - Study time
  - Attendance
  - Previous exam scores
  - Assignments completed
  - Absences
  - Demographic attributes (optional)
