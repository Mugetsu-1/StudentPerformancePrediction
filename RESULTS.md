# Project Result

## Final Outcome
- The machine learning models were able to predict student pass/fail status effectively using academic and behavioral features.
- Random Forest performed best among the tested models.

---

## Through Math-Student Dataset

- Logistic Regression: ~75–80% accuracy

- Decision Tree: ~78–83% accuracy

- Random Forest: ~85–90% accuracy [Which was the best one]

---

## Key Findings

- G1 and G2 (previous grades) were the strongest predictors.

- Study time positively affected performance.

- Absences and previous failures negatively affected pass probability.

- Models (Random Forest) captured non-linear patterns better.

# Multiple classification models were trained to predict student performance. Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy (~88%) and recall, indicating strong predictive capability. Academic features such as previous grades (G1, G2) and study time had the highest influence on predictions
